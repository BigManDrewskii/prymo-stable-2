## 🎤 **Presenter Notes**

### **Speaking Tips**
- **Speak slowly and clearly** - allow time for audience to absorb
- **Pause after key points** - let important features sink in
- **Use confident language** - "Notice how..." instead of "I think..."
- **Engage the audience** - "As you can see..." "This demonstrates..."

### **Technical Tips**
- **Have backup tabs open** with each step pre-loaded
- **Use incognito mode** to simulate new user experience
- **Keep demo focused** - don't get sidetracked by minor features
- **Practice timing** - know exactly how long each section takes

### **Handling Questions**
- **"How does the email capture work?"** → Explain Tally integration and automatic extraction
- **"Is this secure?"** → Highlight localStorage, HTTPS, and privacy features
- **"What if Tally is down?"** → Mention error handling and fallback options
- **"Can this scale?"** → Discuss cloud deployment and performance optimizations
